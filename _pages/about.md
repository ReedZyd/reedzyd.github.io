I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/), under the supervision of [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/?_gl=1*iopzok*_ga*NTk4Mzc5NDExLjE2ODA3NzUyNjU.*_ga_JN37M497TT*MTY5ODMzMjE2My4yOC4xLjE2OTgzMzIxODEuNDIuMC4w) and [Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/). Prior to that, I spent a three-year master's period in the [Visual, Sensing and Intelligent System Laboratory](http://www.vsislab.com/), School of Control Science and Engineering, [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) (SDU). My advisor is Prof. Wei Zhang. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation at SDU.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning (especially causal RL), and embodied AI.
